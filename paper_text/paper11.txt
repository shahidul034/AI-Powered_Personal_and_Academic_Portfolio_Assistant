# Classification of Motor Imagery EEG Signals Using Deep Learning

---

## Abstract
This study evaluates and compares the performance of three deep learning models—Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)—for classifying motor imagery EEG (Electroencephalography) signals. The goal is to provide insights into the neural processes underlying motor control, which can be applied to therapies for neurological diseases like stroke and Parkinson's disease. The models were trained on a dataset of right- and left-hand motor imagery movements collected from two healthy, right-handed male volunteers. After preprocessing the EEG signals and extracting linear and nonlinear features, the Bi-LSTM model achieved the highest average performance with a 96.84% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, 98.72% specificity, and 96.80% F1-score. This research demonstrates the potential of deep learning methods for developing efficient and accurate brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

## Problem Statement
Motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) use EEG signals to detect brain activity patterns related to imagined movements, which can help disabled individuals perform daily tasks. However, classifying these motor imagery EEG signals quickly and accurately remains a significant challenge. This is due to several factors, including physiological differences between individuals, variations in electrode placement and skull thickness, and changes in a person's mental state over time. These challenges make it difficult to develop robust, universally applicable models for interpreting EEG data. An accurate classification model could have a profound impact on developing new therapies and assistive technologies for patients with neurological disorders that affect motor control, such as stroke.

## Objectives
- To evaluate and compare the performance of three deep learning models: **ANN, DNN, and Bi-LSTM**, for the classification of two-class motor imagery EEG data (left-hand vs. right-hand movements).
- To establish a clear methodology for signal preprocessing and feature extraction from EEG data to improve model performance.
- To demonstrate the effectiveness of these deep learning models for classifying motor imagery EEG data and their potential use in developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
- To provide a detailed comparison of the deep learning methods to guide future research in creating more efficient and accurate BCIs.

## Methodology
The research followed a systematic approach to collect, preprocess, and classify motor imagery EEG signals.

1.  **Dataset Acquisition**: EEG data was collected from two healthy, right-handed male volunteers using a 9-channel B-AlertX10 system. Each subject participated in four sessions, with five trials per session, resulting in 20 trials for each of the two classes: right-hand and left-hand motor imagery movements. The data was sampled at a rate of 256 Hz.
    
2.  **Signal Preprocessing**: The raw EEG signals, which were a combination of signal and noise, underwent several preprocessing steps:
    - **Channel Selection**: Only four channels (F3, F4, C3, and C4) were selected as they are associated with left- and right-hand movements.
    - **Filtering**: A Butterworth band-pass filter (0.5-60 Hz) and a 50 Hz notch filter were applied to remove out-of-band noise and powerline noise.
    - **Smoothing**: Median and moving average filters with a window size of 3 were used to reduce high-frequency noise and further smooth the signal.
    - **Normalization**: The entire database was normalized to simplify the tracking of future results.
    
3.  **Feature Extraction**: Both linear and nonlinear features were extracted from the preprocessed signals.
    - **Linear Features**: Included the average band power for five frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) and the Theta to Beta Ratio (TBR).
    - **Nonlinear Features**: Included Sample Entropy, Dispersion Entropy, and MultiScale Sample Entropy. The total number of input features was 36.

4.  **Modeling and Classification**: The preprocessed and feature-extracted data were used to train and evaluate three deep learning models:
    - **ANN**: A feedforward ANN with two dense layers, batch normalization, and a sigmoid activation function for the output.
    - **DNN**: A sequential DNN with a dropout layer to prevent overfitting and a sigmoid output layer for binary classification.
    - **Bi-LSTM**: A Bidirectional LSTM model with two stacked Bi-LSTM layers and a dropout layer. The final layer was a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

5.  **Evaluation**: Stratified K-Fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the models, ensuring that each fold maintained the same proportion of target classes as the full dataset. The performance was measured using four key metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.

## Key Findings
- **Bi-LSTM Superiority**: The Bidirectional LSTM model achieved the highest average classification performance across all metrics. It recorded an average accuracy of **96.84%**, sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 98.72%, and an F1-score of 96.80%. For a single subject, it achieved up to 98.73% accuracy.
- **DNN as a Strong Performer**: The Deep Neural Network (DNN) also performed well, consistently achieving the second-highest scores, with an average accuracy of 94.94% for one subject.
- **Improved Performance with Signal Processing**: The study demonstrated that the combination of multiple filters and normalization significantly improved the quality of the EEG signals, which is crucial for accurate classification.
- **Comparison to Prior Work**: The models developed in this study, particularly the Bi-LSTM and DNN, significantly outperformed other models cited in the literature, which had accuracies ranging from 58.26% to 79.43%.

## Applications
- The developed classification techniques can be used to create highly accurate **brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)**.
- These BCIs can be used to help patients with neurological diseases, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, regain physical mobility and perform daily tasks.
- The methodology can be applied to motor skill training and rehabilitation programs, as motor imagery is known to help reorganize neural networks in the brain.

## Limitations
- The study's main limitation is the small number of participants (two physically fit male volunteers). Increasing the number of subjects would improve the reliability and generalizability of the findings.
- The Bi-LSTM model, while highly accurate, was found to be **time-consuming** during the experimentation phase.
- The study was limited to a two-class classification (left-hand vs. right-hand movements).

## Future Directions
- Future research should focus on increasing the number of participants to enhance the generalizability of the findings.
- The classification task could be extended to a multi-class scenario, including left-hand, right-hand, and both-hand movements.
- A future project could involve implementing the final phases of a BCI, such as translating the classified signals into commands for a robotic arm.
